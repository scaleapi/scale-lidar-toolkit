Final Thoughts and Tips
=======================

We hope that the template script and this guide will help make debugging
lidar data and creating tasks a smoother process. Here are some more
tips that may help.

.. seealso:: Remember to check the object `Transform <https://scaleapi.github.io/scale-lidar-toolkit/scale_lidar_io.html#scale-lidar-io-transform-transform>`__ from **scale_lidar_io**, this will help you with all the algebraic operation (matrix multiplication, subtraction, etc.). Also you can create a Transform object using different type of data, not only matrixes. Transforms prints translate your matrixes into simple components to help you understand your data.

Extra tips
****************

**Subtracting a matrix from another matrix:**

.. code-block:: python

  matrix_one = Transform(np.eye(4))
  matrix_two = Transform(numpy.indices((4, 4)))

  print(matrix_one @ matrix_two.inverse)

.. seealso::   Remember that the order of the element matters in matrix multiplication, it is not the same

**The lidar toolkit's expected input format**

The lidar toolkit expects data in a specific format to construct the
output json. If something errors out or does not make sense, remember to
check how the lidar toolkit operates. There is the chance that a pose
was applied twice, or the raw data was using a quaternion and the lidar
toolkit was expecting a rotation matrix.

My Data Still Looks Bad
****************************

In the section `Lidar toolkit In depth / Troubleshooting your
data <https://scaleapi.github.io/scale-lidar-toolkit/in_depth/intro.html>`__ we have more cases of how to debug and load your data
into the lidar toolkit. When in doubt, reach out to your Scale
Engagement Manager.
